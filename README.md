# Rock-Paper-Scissors-

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to make an app that allows a user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer player. There are two different options for game play, a classic version and a hard version with the addition of the options of lizard and alien to game play. Both players scores are kept track of in the sidebars and one there is a running score the button to change game appears. When the game is changed the scores remain the same. The game times out after no activity and returns to the game selection page.

## Learning Goals
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of: DRY JavaScript
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

## Technology
This project was created with VS Code, Google devTools, gitHub, and the Terminal
- It is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Wins and Challenges
wins: Developed a better understanding of the data model and DOM
challenges: Git workflow; remembering to make frequent commits and pushes and pulls was easier in a group setting
