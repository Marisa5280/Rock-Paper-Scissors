# Rock-Paper-Scissors-

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to make an app that allows a user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer player. There are two different options for game play, a classic version and a hard version with the addition of the options of lizard and alien to game play. Both players scores are kept track of in the sidebars and one there is a running score the button to change game appears. When the game is changed the scores remain the same. The game times out after no activity and returns to the game selection page.
